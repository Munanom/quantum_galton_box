# Quantum Galton Board Implementation Summary

## Overview

This project extended a 1- and 2-layer Quantum Galton Board to a generalized algorithm for any number of layers, implemented using Qiskit on the `FakeMontrealV2` backend, a 27-qubit emulator with realistic noise. The objectives were to simulate binomial, exponential, and Hadamard quantum walk distributions, verify Gaussian convergence for the binomial case, optimize performance under noise, and compute distance metrics with stochastic uncertainty.

## Generalized Algorithm and Gaussian Verification

The `QuantumGaltonBoard` class was developed to create quantum circuits for an arbitrary number of layers (`num_levels`). Each qubit undergoes a Hadamard gate, simulating a binomial distribution (`p=0.5`), with measurement outcomes (number of 1s) representing positions. Using `qiskit-aer`’s `qasm_simulator`, we ran experiments with 8 levels and 1000 shots, both noiseless and with `FakeMontrealV2` noise. The noiseless simulation yielded a binomial distribution with a mean of 3.94 (theoretical: 4.00) and standard deviation of 1.44 (theoretical: 1.41). The `test_gaussian_convergence` method tested levels [4, 8, 12, 16], confirming Gaussian convergence per the central limit theorem. Plots saved to the `output/` folder showed experimental histograms aligning closely with theoretical binomial and Gaussian distributions (mean `n*0.5`, standard deviation `sqrt(n*0.25)`).

## Modified Distributions

The `AdvancedQuantumGaltonBoard` class extended the framework to simulate exponential and Hadamard quantum walk distributions using a noiseless all-to-all sampler (`qasm_simulator`). For the exponential distribution, we used Qiskit’s `StatePreparation` to encode probabilities with `lambda=1.5` and 6 precision bits, achieving an exponential decay profile. The Hadamard quantum walk employed a coin qubit and 5 position qubits, with optimized multi-controlled gates for shifting, simulating 6 steps. Both distributions matched theoretical expectations: exponential decay and a symmetric, Gaussian-like spread, respectively, as visualized in output plots.

## Noisy Hardware Optimization

To maximize accuracy under noise, we used the `FakeMontrealV2` noise model, simulating IBM quantum hardware errors. The binomial circuit was optimized by minimizing gate depth (Hadamard gates only) and tested up to 8 levels. The exponential circuit used efficient state preparation, and the Hadamard walk reduced gate count via multi-controlled gates. Despite noise, the binomial simulation achieved excellent distance metrics: KL divergence (0.0045 ± 0.0022), JS divergence (0.0012 ± 0.0007), and total variation (0.0223 ± 0.0081). Measurement mitigation (`CompleteMeasFitter`) was attempted but disabled due to missing `qiskit-experiments`, yet results remained robust.

## Distance Metrics and Uncertainty

The `utils.py` module computed KL divergence, JS divergence, and total variation between experimental and theoretical distributions, with stochastic uncertainty estimated over 5 runs. A critical fix in `utils.py` handled `FakeMontrealV2`’s padded bitstrings by counting 1s in the first `num_levels` bits, ensuring accurate position mapping. Low distance metrics confirmed high fidelity to theoretical distributions, with uncertainties reflecting statistical variations.

## Challenges and Future Work

Challenges included handling padded bitstrings and missing mitigation dependencies. Upgrading to Python 3.10 and installing `qiskit-experiments` are recommended for enhanced mitigation. Future work could scale to more levels, test on real IBM hardware, or further optimize gate sequences for noise resilience.

## Conclusion

We successfully generalized the Quantum Galton Board, verified Gaussian convergence, implemented diverse distributions, and optimized for noisy hardware. Low distance metrics and comprehensive visualizations (saved to `output/`) demonstrate high accuracy, making this a robust quantum simulation framework.
